Good morning Alex.
I'm having an annoying problem creating flight plan with LMNP.
When I enter the take-off (SID) and landing (STAR) procedures, the flight profile flattens out at the cruising altitude, from the departure airport to the destination.
The Altitude column in the flight plan table also becomes blank.
If, on the other hand, I work without these procedures, it shows me the ascent and descent correctly.
What could it depend on.
Thank you.

A widely configurable map display using the OpenStreetMap as a background map which is only one
option of many online and included offline maps. The map shows airports, navaids, airways,
airspaces, AI or multiplayer aircraft and ships as well as airport weather, winds aloft and a minimum off-route altitude grid (MORA). A seamlessly integrated airport diagram displays
taxiways, displaced thresholds, overrun areas, aprons, parking spots and more.

User can place airport traffic patterns or holdings as a visual guidance on the map .

It supports approach and departure procedures like SIDs, STARs, custom final approaches, offers several automatic flight
plan calculation options and multiple export formats like GFP \(Reality XP GTN and Flight1 GTN\),
FPL \(Reality XP GNS\), GPX, RTE, FLP and X-Plane FMS as well as
drag and drop flight plan editing on the map. The program can read the PLN, FMS and FLP flight plan
formats.

Keyboard shortcuts help to access most functions without mouse.

An elevation profile is shown for the flight plan allowing to find a safe cruise altitude also displaying top climb,
top of descent and procedure altitude restrictions. Calculated and shown climb as well as descent paths adhere to altitude
restrictions .

Aircraft performance and fuel planning is included which automatically considers winds aloft for fuel, top of climb and top of descent calculation. Performance values can be collected automatically during flight and can be merged into the currently profile at any time.

Search functionality allows to look for airports, navaids, procedures, user defined waypoints and logbook entries by a large amount of
criteria also including a spatial search.

_Little Navmap_ comes with its own logbook allowing to automatically record, search and edit logbook entries.

The program can generate an ATS route description from flight plans and vice versa where the output is widely configurable.

The nav database can be updated by the _Navigraph FMS Data Manager_. A cycle 1801 database
courtesy of Navigraph is included in the download and includes navaids, airways, airspaces, procedures and more.

Complete edit, display, import and export functionality for user defined waypoints.
Import and export of CSV, X-Plane and Garmin files.

Display of clients and centers of VATSIM and custom online networks.

_Little Navmap_ features its own internal web server which allows to follow aircraft progress from any device.
